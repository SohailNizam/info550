For this assignment please turn in to Canvas a plain text file with your GitHub user name. You will then be assigned to peer grade another student's repository. 

1. Create a GitHub repository for your class project and push all files needed to execute your data analysis project and produce a report to GitHub. Include a `README.md` file that contains detailed instructions on how to execute your analysis. This README should explicitly spell out what software/packages need to be installed prior to running the analysis and contain bash code that is required to execute the analysis. See the [example repository](https://github.com/benkeser/info550project) for an example. 

Your repository will be peer-graded for its clarity. You will be asked to download one of your classmates' repository and try to run their code. 

Some hints:

* Avoid absolute paths. Note that if you run an `R` session from the command line, then the working directory for the session is whatever folder `R` was run from. 
* When peer grading, don't chase down package install errors. If they happen, note them for your classmate, but no need to try harder.
* If the `Rmd` file errors, note the error in your grading. 

For this to work, you may need to make your data anonymous. An easy way to do this in R is follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# say you have a data.frame called dat where rows are individuals 
# and columns are features

# set a seed that only you know -- don't save it anywhere
set.seed(124125)
n <- nrow(dat)
new_dat <- dat
for(j in 1:ncol(dat)){
	shuffle_idx <- sample(1:n)
	new_dat[,j] <- dat[shuffle_idx, j]
}

# new dat now contains data formatted like your original data, but 
# where each column has been randomly shuffled. use this version in 
# your repository
```
